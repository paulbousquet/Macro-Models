# Macro Models: Extensions and Replications
* Asymmetric Price and Wage Rigities in NK from [Aruoba, Bocola, and Schorfheide (2017)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188917301562)
  * Fixed some minor issues in the code and wrote out the model equations implied by their programs  
* [Elastic Interest Rate](https://www.columbia.edu/~mu2166/closing.htm) from [Schmitt-Groh√© and Uribe (2003)](https://www.columbia.edu/~mu2166/closing_jie.pdf)
  * Updated codes to current Matlab syntax and added second-order approximation
* HANK from the [Sequence Space Jacobian (SSJ) Repository](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian)
  * For the one and two asset HANK model, looks more in depth into effects of interest rate shock, both at household and aggregate level
* Wage Price Spiral from [Lorenzoni and Werning (2023)](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5_Lorenzoni-Werning_unembargoed.pdf)
  * Replicate Figure 2 and extended model to multisector, closed economy case. Multisector, open economy available upon request   
* Miscellaneous
  * A collection of model codes I didn't write myself or modify at all
