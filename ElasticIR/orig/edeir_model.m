%EDEIR_MODEL.M Small Open Economy With An External Debt-Elastic Interest Rate as presented in chapter 4 of ``Open Economy Macroeconomics,'' by Martin Uribe, 2013.
%Run this program only once or every time the structure of the model changes. No need to re run it when parameter values change. 
%model.m computes a symbolic  log-linear approximation to the  function f, which defines  the DSGE model: 
%  E_t f(yp,y,xp,x) =0. 
%here, a p denotes next-period variables.  
%
%Output: Analytical expressions for f and its first derivatives as well as x and y. The output is written to <filename>_num_eval.m which can then be run for numerical evaluations
%
%Calls: anal_deriv.m and anal_deriv_print2f.m
